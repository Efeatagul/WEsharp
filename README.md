WE# (WeSharp) - Version 0.01
WE# is a modular, general-purpose programming language developed on the C# infrastructure. It serves as the core engine for the we(x) ecosystem, designed with a focus on structured logic and an interactive command-line interface.

Technical Specifications
Base Framework: Built using C# and .NET.

Architecture: Features a custom Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter for source code execution.

Interactive Shell: Implements a specialized input/output system using user > for commands and reply: for system responses.

Error Handling: Supports block-based syntax using curly braces { } to ensure code integrity and structured execution.

Syntax Overview
The language is designed to be intuitive yet strictly governed by its internal logic. Future iterations aim to expand the standard library and integrate file-based execution.

Example
Kod snippet'i

check(x == 10) {
    out("Value is correct.")
}
