WE# (WeSharp) - Evolution Log
 Day 1: The Foundation (v0.01 - Beta)
Focus: Core Architecture & Syntax Establishment

Core Development: Built the fundamental Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter skeleton.

Logic Systems: Implemented check (if) structures and support for curly brace { } code blocks.

Interface: Created a specialized interactive CLI shell using user > for inputs and reply: for system responses.

Basic Syntax: Enabled basic variable assignments and terminal output functions (out).

 Day 2: Graphics & Logic Expansion (v0.02 - Current)
Focus: Visual Output, Hardware Interaction & Modular Libraries

Graphics Engine: Integrated drawlib.cs for full window management. Added capabilities for drawing shapes (draw_circle, draw_rect) and rendering text.

Hardware Interaction: Added real-time keyboard tracking (is_key) and instant mouse coordinates (mouse_x, mouse_y) for interactive applications.

Advanced Library Suite:

String Manipulation: Added Regex-based str_slug, str_replace, and advanced text cleaning tools.

System Utilities: Introduced file system operations (file_read, file_write) and JSON processing support.

Interpreter Optimization:

Functional Growth: Enabled nested function calls and the ability to capture and use function return values.

Rendering Stability: Solved graphical flickering issues by implementing a Reflection-based DoubleBuffered fix.

 Technical Specifications
Base Framework: Built using .NET and C#.

Architecture: Modular Multi-Library System (Standard, Advanced, and Drawing libraries).

Execution Model: Real-time Interpretation with Dynamic Function Mapping.
